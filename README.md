# Startup Profit Prediction

This repository contains an analysis and prediction model for the profit of startup companies based on their spending on R&D, Administration, and Marketing. The dataset includes financial information for 50 startups.


# Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the profit of startup companies based on their R&D Spend, Administration Cost, and Marketing Spend. By understanding these relationships, startups can better allocate their resources to maximize profit.

# Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

R&D Spend: Money spent on research and development.
Administration: Operational expenses.
Marketing Spend: Money allocated to marketing activities.
Profit: The resulting profit.
The dataset provides insights into the central tendencies and variability of each financial metric, highlighting the distribution and spread across the startup landscape.

# Methodology
The methodology consists of the following steps:

1 Data Analysis: Examining the significance of each variable.
2 Statistical Summary: Understanding central tendencies and variability.
3 Correlation Analysis: Uncovering relationships between variables.
4 Visualization: Using scatter plots to visualize dynamics.
5 Modeling: Applying various regression algorithms.
6 Evaluation: Comparing model performance using accuracy, R-squared score, MSE, and MAE.
# Implementation
